# GitHub Upload Checklist

## ✅ Before Uploading

### 1. Close All Programs
- Close VS Code, WebStorm, or any IDE
- Close any terminal windows
- Close any running development servers

### 2. Run Cleanup (Optional)
- Run `cleanup.bat` as administrator if needed
- Or manually delete problematic folders

### 3. Verify Project Structure
Your project should look like this:
```
expense-tracker/
├── frontend/
│   ├── src/
│   ├── package.json
│   ├── tsconfig.json
│   └── next-env.d.ts
├── backend/
│   ├── controllers/
│   ├── models/
│   ├── routes/
│   ├── package.json
│   └── app.js
├── .gitignore
├── README.md
├── SETUP_GUIDE.md
├── cleanup.bat
└── UPLOAD_CHECKLIST.md
```

## ✅ What to Upload to GitHub

### ✅ Include These Files/Folders:
- `frontend/` folder (without node_modules)
- `backend/` folder (without node_modules)
- `.gitignore`
- `README.md`
- `SETUP_GUIDE.md`
- `cleanup.bat`
- `UPLOAD_CHECKLIST.md`

### ❌ Do NOT Upload:
- `frontend/node_modules/`
- `backend/node_modules/`
- `frontend/.next/` (will be created by `npm run build`)
- Any `.env` files
- `package-lock.json` files (optional)

## ✅ GitHub Upload Steps

1. **Go to GitHub.com** and sign in
2. **Click "New repository"**
3. **Name your repository** (e.g., "expense-tracker")
4. **Make it Public or Private** (your choice)
5. **Don't initialize with README** (you already have one)
6. **Click "Create repository"**
7. **Upload files** by dragging and dropping the folders/files
8. **Make sure to exclude the problematic folders**

## ✅ After Uploading

1. **Clone the repository** on any machine
2. **Follow SETUP_GUIDE.md** for installation
3. **Run `npm install`** in both frontend and backend folders
4. **Create environment files** as described in the setup guide

## ✅ Troubleshooting

### If you can't delete node_modules:
1. Restart your computer
2. Run cleanup.bat as administrator
3. Or just upload without node_modules (they'll be recreated)

### If TypeScript shows errors:
- This is normal without node_modules
- Errors will disappear after `npm install`

### If GitHub upload fails:
- Check file sizes (should be small without node_modules)
- Try uploading in smaller batches
- Make sure you're not uploading node_modules folders
